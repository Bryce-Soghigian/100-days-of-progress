# 100 days of progress
The purpose of this project is for you to set goals that you want to achieve in the next 100 days. Without a clear plan and way of enforcing that you stick to that plan you will get nowhere. 

So the primary objective here is to set a goal you want to acheive in 100 days and then your daily progress torward that goal. Every day morning you need to reflect on your goal and the daily actionable steps to reach it. 
Then each evening you need to reflect on your daily progress.

Every 10 days you then reflect on your progress in the past 10 day cycle. I will prepare documents you can copy paste and use for accountability. 100 Days at a time you will see your goals through and achieve what you want out of life.


First things first lets declare a goal you have something you want to achieve that will take serious willpower. 

## Describe your Goal


## Why do you want to accomplish this goal?


## How will you know if you have successfully accomplished this goal?

## When will you accomplish this goal by? 

## What are the tools you will be using to acheive this goal? What is missing from your current routine/assets to achieve this?

## Who can help you achieve this goal?


## What is your 100 day goal? In 100 days how far do you plan on getting? 

## What is your first 10 day goal to put you on your path to 100 days of progress?



Now every day you have to reflect on your goals using the daily sheet. Then after 10 days have passed used the every 10 days sheet!
